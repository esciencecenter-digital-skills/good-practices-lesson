:::instructor
Use [these slides](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/digital-skills-slides/modules/good-practices-lesson/documentation-slides) as
a guidance.

The main purpose of this lesson is to make sure participants understand that DOCUMENTATION IS IMPORTANT. The goal is more to trigger participants then to teach them all the different ways one could document a project. It is good to communicate this (and that this will give more time for the other parts of the workshop).

:::

## Why we teach this lesson

Specific motivations:

- Code documentation should be part of your source code so that it remains easily accessible and maintainable for all users.
- Good documentation allows others to install and make use of your code independently and increase the impact of your project.
- Documentation can facilitate collaborations by helping us onboard new project members quickly and more easily.
- By writing documention you think about the design of your code.



## What makes a good documentation?

::: challenge
### Exercise: Think of good and bad examples 
Write down your thoughts in the collaborative documents.
Respond with emojis :+1: :scream_cat: to your colleagues' answers.
- Think of projects of which you like the documentation. What do you like about them?
- Think of projects for which you don’t like the documentation. What don’t you like about them? Are you missing anything?

**NB: You can choose a mature library with lots of users for this exercise, but try to also think of less mature projects you had to collaborate on, or papers you had to reproduce.**

:::: solution
- It is important to document code
- Think about the people reading your documentation (your audience)
- Depending on the purpose and state of the project documentation needs to meet different criteria. 
- For most scientific projects, in-code documentation and a well thought out README file is enough.
- Documentation should be tracked with corresponding code
::::
:::

## Types of documentation
There are different types of documentation:

- README and CITATION files
- in-code documentation (Docstrings)
- Tutorials


## Writing good README files
The README file is the first thing a user/collaborator sees. It should include:

- A descriptive project title
- Motivation (why the project exists)
- How to setup
- Copy-pastable quick start code example
- Link or instructions for contributing
- Badges
- Citation 


::: challenge
### Exercise README: Draft or improve a README for one of your recent projects (in breakout rooms)

Try to draft a brief README or review a README which you have written for one of your projects.

You can work individually, but you could also discuss whether anything can be improved on your neighbour's README file(s).

Think about the user (which can be a future you) of your project, what does this user need to know to use or contribute to the project? And how do you make your project attractive to use or contribute to?

(Optional): Try the https://hemingwayapp.com/ to analyse your README file and make your writing bold and clear.

### Badges
TODO: What they are, suggest zenodo, pytest, code coverage, documentation, licence.
Link to shields.io

### Citation ()
TODO: introduce CITATION.cff, cffinit.
TODO: Add exercise.

## In-code documentation 

Documentation strings:
- Makes code more understandable
- Explains decisions we made

### When not to use in-code documentation:
- When the code is self-explanatory
- To replace good variable/function names
- To replace version control
- To keep old (zombie) code around

### Readable code vs commented code
```python
# convert from degrees celsius to fahrenheit
def convert(d):
    return d * 5 / 9 + 32
```

vs

```python
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(degrees):
    return degrees * 5 / 9 + 32
```


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Writing good comments - In-code-1: Comments

Let's take a look at two example comments (comments in Python start with `#`):

**Comment A**

```python
  # now we check if temperature is below -50
  if temperature < -50:
      print("ERROR: temperature is too low")
```

**Comment B**

```python
  # we regard temperatures below -50 degrees as measurement errors
  if temperature < -50:
      print("ERROR: temperature is too low")
```

**Which of these comments is more useful? Can you explain why?**

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

+ **Comment A** describes **what** happens in this piece of code. This can be
    useful for somebody who has never seen Python or a program, but for somebody
    who has, it can feel like a redundant commentary.
+ **Comment B** is probably more useful as it describes **why** this piece of code
    is there, i.e. its **purpose**.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### What are "docstrings" and how can they be useful?

Here is function `fahrenheit_to_celsius` which converts temperature in
Fahrenheit to Celsius.

The first set of examples uses **regular comments**:

```python
# This function converts a temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius.
def fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp_f: float) -> float:
    temp_c = (temp_f - 32.0) * (5.0/9.0)
    return temp_c
```

The second set uses **docstrings or similar concepts**. Please compare the two
(above and below):

```py
def fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp_f: float) -> float:
    """
    Converts a temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius.

    Parameters
    ----------
    temp_f : float
        The temperature in Fahrenheit.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The temperature in Celsius.
    """

    temp_c = (temp_f - 32.0) * (5.0/9.0)
    return temp_c
```

Docstrings are more powerful than comments:

- Docstrings are automatically extracted when calling the help function.
- Tools can generate documentation pages automatically from docstrings known as API documentation.

It is common to write docstrings for functions, classes, and modules.

TODO: Introduce how to write docstrings and show an example of API documentation.
Good docstrings describe:
- What the function does
- What goes in (including the type of the input variables)
- What goes out (including the return type)


**Naming is documentation**:
Giving explicit, descriptive names to your code segments (functions, classes,
variables) already provides very useful and important documentation. In
practice you will find that for simple functions it is unnecessary to add a
docstring when the function name and variable names already give enough
information.

TODO: Add docstring exercise. 
Idea add docstrings to convertion function and improve naming.


## Tools for generating and deploying documentation
You can use the following tools to generate user or API documentation.

### Generating documentation 

MkDocs and Sphinx:
- creates nicely-formatted HTML pages out of .md or .rST files
- programming language independent


#### Sphinx
Like MkDocs, Sphinx is a documetatation generator which translates a set of plain text source files into various output formats. It natively supports reStructuredText (rST) and with some extensions also supports Markdown.

::: instructor

Please note that Sphinx is an optional part in this workshop which depends om the progress of the participants. There are optional exercises which can be completed by those participants who are faster. 

:::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  spoiler

##### Sphinx quickstart demo and optional exercises

Create a directory for the example documentation, step into it, and inside
generate the basic documentation template:

```console
$ mkdir doc-example
$ cd doc-example
$ sphinx-quickstart
```

The quickstart utility will ask you some questions. For this exercise, you can go
with the default answers except to specify a project name, author name, and project release:

```
> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: <hit enter>
> Project name: <your project name>
> Author name(s): <your name>
> Project release []: 0.1
> Project language [en]: <hit enter>
```

A couple of files and directories are created:

| File/directory | Contents |
| -------------- | -------- |
| conf.py        | Documentation configuration file |
| index.rst      | Main file in Sphinx |
| _build/        | Directory where docs are built (you can decide the name) |
| _templates/    | Your own HTML templates |
| _static/       | Static files (images, styles, etc.) copied to output directory on build |
| Makefile       | Makefile to build documentation using make |
| make.bat       | Makefile to build documentation using make (Windows) |

`Makefile` and `make.bat` (for Windows) are build scripts that wrap the sphinx commands, but
we will be doing it explicitly.

Let's have a look at the `index.rst` file, which is the main file of your documentation:

```rst
.. myproject documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Sat Sep 23 17:35:26 2023.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to myproject's documentation!
=====================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:


Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
```

- We will not use the `Indices and tables` section now, so remove it and everything below.
- The top four lines, starting with `..`, are a comment.
- The next lines are the table of contents. We can add content below:

```rst
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

   some-feature.md
```
Note that `some-feature.md` needs to be indented to align with `:caption:`.

We now need to tell Sphinx to use markdown files. To do this, we open
`conf.py` and replace the line:
```python
extensions = []
```

with this line so that Sphinx can parse Markdown files:
```python
extensions = ['myst_parser']
```

Let's create the file `some-feature.md` (in Markdown format) which we have just listed in
`index.rst` (which uses reStructured Text format).

```md
# Some feature

## Subsection

Exciting documentation in here.
Let's make a list (empty surrounding lines required):

- item 1

  - nested item 1
  - nested item 2

- item 2
- item 3
```

We now build the site:

```console
$ ls -1

_static
_templates
conf.py
index.rst
make.bat
Makefile
some-feature.md

$ sphinx-build . _build

... lots of output ...
build succeeded.

The HTML pages are in _build.

$ ls -1 _build

_sources
_static
genindex.html
index.html
objects.inv
search.html
searchindex.js
some-feature.html
```

Now open the file `_build/index.html` in your browser.
- Linux users, type:
  ```console
  $ xdg-open _build/index.html
  ```
- macOS users, type:
  ```console
  $ open _build/index.htmlgit
  ```
- Windows users, type:
  ```console
  $ start _build/index.html
  ```
- If the above does not work:
  Enter `file:///home/user/doc-example/_build/index.html` in your browser (adapting the path to your case).

Hopefully you can now see a website. If so, then you are able to build Sphinx pages locally.
This is useful to check how things look before pushing changes to GitHub or elsewhere.

Note that you can change the styling by editing `conf.py` and changing the value `html_theme`
(for instance you can set it to `sphinx_rtd_theme` (if you have that Python package installed)
to have the Read the Docs look).



::: challenge

##### (Optional) exercise: Adding more Sphinx content

1. Add a entry below `some-feature.md` labeled `another-feature.md` (or a better name) to the `index.rst` file.
2. Create a file `another-feature.md` in the same directory as the `index.rst` file.
3. Add some content to `another-feature.md`, rebuild with `sphinx-build . _build`, and refresh the browser to look at the results.
4. Use the [MyST Typography](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/typography.html) page as help.

Experiment with the following Markdown syntax:

- \*Emphasized text\* and \*\*bold text\*\*

- Headings:
```md
# Level 1

## Level 2

### Level 3

#### Level 4
```

- An image: `![alt text](image.png)`

- `[A link](https://www.example.org)`

- Numbered lists (numbers adjusted automatically):
```md
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3
1. item 4
1. item 5
```

- Simple tables:
```md
| No.  |  Prime |
| ---- | ------ |
| 1    |  No    |
| 2    |  Yes   |
| 3    |  Yes   |
| 4    |  No    |
```

- Code blocks:
````markdown
The following is a Python code block:
```python
  def hello():
      print("Hello world")
```

And this is a C code block:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```
````

- You could include an external file (here we assume a file called "example.py"
  exists; at the same time we highlight lines 2 and 3):
````markdown
```{literalinclude} example.py
:language: python
:emphasize-lines: 2-3
```
````

- We can also use Jupyter notebooks (*.ipynb) with Sphinx. It requires the
  [myst-nb](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/) extension to be installed.

##### (Optional) exercise Adding Math equations


Math equations should work out of the box. In some older versions, you might need
to edit `conf.py` and add `sphinx.ext.mathjax`:
```python
extensions = ['myst_parser', 'sphinx.ext.mathjax']
```

Try this (result below):
````markdown
This creates an equation:
```{math}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
```

This is an in-line equation, {math}`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`, embedded in text.
````

This creates an equation:
```{math}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
```

This is an in-line equation, {math}`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`, embedded in text.
:::

::: challenge
##### (Optional) exercise: Adding API documentation

1. Write some docstrings in functions and/or class definitions of an `example` python module:
```python
def multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    Multiply two numbers.

    :param a: First number.
    :param b: Second number.
    :return: The product of a and b.
    """
    return a * b
```

2. In the file `conf.py` modify "extensions" and add 3 lines:
```python
extensions = ['myst_parser', "autodoc2"]

autodoc2_packages = [
    "multiply.py"
]
```

4. List `apidocs/index` in the toctree in `index.rst`.
```rst
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

   some-feature.md
   apidocs/index
```

5. Re-build the documentation and check the "API reference" section.

### Deploying documentation using Github pages

- set up inside your GitHub repository
- automatically deploys your Sphinx-generated documentation

::: instructor
You can show the example documentation deployed on GitHub pages here: https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/good-practices-documentation-example/

Then, you can show that this content comes from simple markdown files, like: https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/good-practices-documentation-example/blob/main/doc/another-feature.md?plain=1

In addition, you can explain that with a few settings you can automatically generate documentation from docstrings. You can give https://nanopub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/client.html as an example.

:::


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Depending on the purpose and state of the project documentation needs to meet different criteria.
- Good README files provide a good landing place for anyone that is new to your project.
- Comments should describe the why for your code not the what.
- Writing docstrings can be a good way to write documentation while you type
  code since it also makes it possible
  to query that information from outside the code or to auto-generate
  documentation pages.
- There are various tools for generating and deploying documentations which translate a set of plain text sources into various output formats.
